1. Electrical design, including schematic, PCB, and 3D model.

2. Real-world assembly, which will cover both mechanical structure and fitting components onto the PCB.

3. Real-world programming and troubleshooting, which will involve building the program for each of the 3 MCUs and testing with the real components.
